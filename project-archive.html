                  <b>Summary:</b> Contributed to the first release of Iris Key Progress Indicator, a data insight platform designed to help Aloa manage and track complex IT project workflows. Collaborated on defining the metrics used by the system’s machine learning models to interpret real-time contractor feedback and translate it into clear progress updates, reducing the need for constant manual check-ins. Built core data processing components in TypeScript and Python, and developed the underlying data layer with SQL, Google Cloud Platform, and AWS to ensure scalability and high performance when handling large datasets. Implemented data visualizations with D3.js and React to present insights in an accessible, actionable format. The platform improved project visibility, streamlined communication, and enhanced productivity across multiple teams.

Just plug in your values through a quick prompt, and the app takes care of the rest, displaying your data right on the page.

The original site was static, built with basic HTML/CSS, and lacked usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. We modernized it using HTML5, Bootstrap (CSS), JavaScript, and ReactJS, creating a more dynamic and mobile-friendly experience. I also contributed to building a searchable file viewing system backed by a custom database, using AJAX and jQuery for smoother interaction. A key part of the project was improving accessibility and overall user experience—we conducted research to ensure the interface was intuitive, efficient, and inclusive. The final result was a much more functional platform that better supports the department’s internal needs.

The new site was built using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, and SQL, with a strong focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and ease of use. It’s more than just a website—it includes smart features like sorting documents by date or priority, automatic updates without manual work, and a centralized JavaScript library that lets developers make changes across all pages from one place. The result is a clean, functional, and user-friendly platform designed to serve both internal staff and the public.

We worked closely with different departments to plan a full transition to a more efficient, SQL-based system that could automate updates and reduce manual work. It was all about making the data easier to manage, faster to access, and ready for the future.

It can even handle certain financial transactions automatically. I worked on defining the metrics that the ML algorithm uses to understand where a project stands, using TypeScript and Python to build those systems.

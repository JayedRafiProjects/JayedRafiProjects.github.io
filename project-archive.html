This unit was responsible to response a significant number of calls and emails everyday regarding certain file search (from more than 1000+ records). This project digitalized the process to reduce work load and increase productivity. It was a long-term collaborative project with other web-team developers and unit. Though the system was built using JavaScript but while working on this project I made tools using Java (text processor) to complete the project on time.</td>

		<td>Description: Around 15 billion trees are cut down every year. Surprisingly the majority percentage of it is for making papers. 
			My initial approach behind working on this project was to reduce this number. 
			This project is a web-based system that helps user create their  QR-readable business card. 
			This platform contains an easy walk-through of creating a QR-readable business card from scratch.  
			It has a design library containing multiple creative designs. 
			I made the whole system open-source so anyone can easily add their design to the library. Another interesting part is the domain validator. 
			It is a script using AJAX. This script checks the already taken folder name on the given server and tells the user about the availability. 
			Also, I tried to make the user interface with a modern look. </td>

		<td>Description: This project is based on data visualization but not limited to numeric values. It is a web-based system and offers 5 different visualization formats (line chart, bar chart, doughnut chart, pie chart &amp; scatter plot). It collects information from the user and evaluates based on Chart.js. Fun fact, while developing it, I used Durstenfeld Shuffle Algorithm to randomize chart colours (pie chart &amp; doughnut chart)on each refresh. Unlike my other projects, this was programmed based on practical implementation (I was planning to use this for making a PowerPoint presentation at work) rather than introducing a new computational algorithm.</td>

		<td>Status / Duration: September 2021</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Description: Though the name seems familiar,  this project is unique. Unlike most other sorting algorithm visualizers, this project does not have any web or desktop interface. Its interface is the output interface of users' Java compiler. From my experience, an advanced text editor like Intellij Idea requires package installation for using additional libraries. It can be a huge obstacle for a student who recently started learning computer science. It helps students to compile and run this application as usual Java files without any package/library installation. Another fascinating part of this project is its calculation algorithm. This algorithm creates a terminal graphic using multi-dimensional arrays.</td>

It uses my value compression algorithm that enables this program to take any value (+ve) from the user and compress it into the frame. It also has additional features like saving the graph as an image to help the research process.</td>

		<td>Description: This project is a graph analysis software. It can be used as both a software interface or statistical analysis tool. This software contains graphical and textual analysis panels that help users analyze the given information accurately. We have used text files as the user input media to keep the software-human interaction process simple. After receiving the data from the user, it processes and visualizes in the simulation panel. This software is designed in a way that if someone wants to use this software as a GUI for their program, it will be easier than ever. The initial version of this project is kept simple (contains a single graph graphics panel with a basic statistical analysis information panel) for further development.</td>
